# Overview

Language translations refer to the various language files available in the `i18n` directory. These files are used to provide translations for different languages. Each file in the `i18n` directory corresponds to a specific language or dialect, identified by its filename. For example, <SwmPath>[i18n/en.json](i18n/en.json)</SwmPath> is for English, <SwmPath>[i18n/es.json](i18n/es.json)</SwmPath> is for Spanish, and <SwmPath>[i18n/fr.json](i18n/fr.json)</SwmPath> is for French.

# Structure of Translation Files

These translation files contain key-value pairs where the key is a message identifier and the value is the translated text. This allows the application to display messages in the user's preferred language. The translation files are essential for internationalization, enabling the application to support multiple languages and provide a localized experience for users around the world.

# Example Translation Files

Below are examples of different translation files and their contents.

<SwmSnippet path="/i18n/es.json" line="241">

---

This file provides translations for Spanish. For example, the key <SwmToken path="i18n/es.json" pos="241:2:6" line-data="	&quot;mwoauth-tag-reserved&quot;: &quot;Las etiquetas que comienzan con &lt;code&gt;OAuth CID:&lt;/code&gt; est치n reservadas para que las use OAuth.&quot;,">`mwoauth-tag-reserved`</SwmToken> is translated to <SwmToken path="i18n/es.json" pos="241:11:44" line-data="	&quot;mwoauth-tag-reserved&quot;: &quot;Las etiquetas que comienzan con &lt;code&gt;OAuth CID:&lt;/code&gt; est치n reservadas para que las use OAuth.&quot;,">`Las etiquetas que comienzan con <code>OAuth CID:</code> est치n reservadas para que las use OAuth.`</SwmToken>

```json
	"mwoauth-tag-reserved": "Las etiquetas que comienzan con <code>OAuth CID:</code> est치n reservadas para que las use OAuth.",
```

This file provides context and descriptions for translators. For example, <SwmToken path="i18n/qqq.json" pos="52:2:6" line-data="	&quot;mwoauth-consumer-callbackisprefix&quot;: &quot;Used as a label for the check box where user can decide if their consumer should use \&quot;Callback URL\&quot; as a string prefix (checked), or if the consumer cannot customize the callback URL in its requests as is required to specify \&quot;oob\&quot; (unchecked, default).&quot;,">`mwoauth-consumer-callbackisprefix`</SwmToken> is used as a label for a checkbox where users can decide if their consumer should use <SwmToken path="i18n/qqq.json" pos="52:47:49" line-data="	&quot;mwoauth-consumer-callbackisprefix&quot;: &quot;Used as a label for the check box where user can decide if their consumer should use \&quot;Callback URL\&quot; as a string prefix (checked), or if the consumer cannot customize the callback URL in its requests as is required to specify \&quot;oob\&quot; (unchecked, default).&quot;,">`Callback URL`</SwmToken> as a string prefix.
